## Description

_An application to track shoe brands and the stores they are in._

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
* As a user, I want to be able to add and list new shoe brands. Shoe brands should include price.
* As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
* As a user, I want to be able to add existing shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
* As a user, I want to be able to associate the same brand of shoes with multiple stores.
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
* As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
* As a user, I want the price to be in currency format even if I just inputted a number. (In other words, typing in 50 should be updated to $50.00.)
* As a user, I do not want stores and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.
* As a user, I want all stores and brands to be unique. There shouldn't be two entries in the database for Blundstone.
